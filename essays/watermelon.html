    <h1>Something about a Watermelon</h1>
    <p><em>24 June 2025</em></p>

    <p>A few days ago, I sliced open a watermelon - as one does on a summer afternoon - and saw something strangely exciting. 
        A pattern. To be more pricise, a plume-like pattern. 
        It reminded me of our instabilities and mantle plumes — 
        how we live on this ball of rocks that's cooling to the space and that loss of heat leads to the a poetic order (and chaos) beneath our feet.</p>

    <p>It made me wonder about order in instability. Why certain flows are beautiful.</p>

    <p>I have a version of this blog that isn't yet quite like I want it be. 
        So until I write it here is an image of that watermelon for you to look at:</p>
