    <h1>My Life List</h1>
    <p>I recently watched the movie <em>The Life List</em>, so you could say that inspired me to start writing mine. 
        I’ll try to update it every few weeks — though we’ll see if that actually happens.</p>
    <p>This is a list of things I want to do, learn, feel, or create in this one short life on this big ball of rock 
        (and yeah, it’s safe to assume I’ll never physically go to outer space — I neither have the means nor the will for that).</p>

    <h2>Things to Feel in My Body</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sleep under the stars (and not panic about bugs)</li>
      <li>Go on a multi-day biking trip (the one where you pack you essentials in a bunch of bike bags 
        and just keep biking for days, say 4 days?)</li>
      <li>Swim 500 meters without stopping</li>
      <li>Do a 10-day retreat (those spiritual/yoga retreats people post do in Thailand or Bali or somehwre like that or maybe jsut Rishikesh if nothing else)</li>
      <li>Try surfing and ride one wave (or fail gracefully)</li>
      <li>Do a pull up: Yes this is a thing that I *aspire* to do and can not currently do</li>
      <li>Do 10 pull ups: If i can do this then I would consider my fittness journey to be complete. Not kidding.</li>
      <li><s>Do 10 knee pushups</s>: Yes, I wrote this just to be able to scratch it off</li>
      <li>Do 10 normal pushups</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Things to do/Learn So I Don’t Rot</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bake a loaf of bread from scratch</li>
      <li>Cook pasta from scratch: I don't think this would be very difficult. I just need to muster up the courage to make the dough myself.</li>
      <li>Learn essentials of fixing a bike</li>
      <li>Drive alone for more than 3 hours so that I can be sure I know how to drive</li>
      <li>Learn how to drive manual</li>
      <li>Road trip with friends</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2>Places to Go Before My Knees Give Up</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Travel 10+ countries</li>
      <li>See the northern lights</li>
      <li><s>Visit New York</s>: NYC has always facinated me since spider-man was from there.</li>
      <li><s>Visit Japan and eat Ramen in a noodle bar</s></li>
      <li><s>Live alone in a small town for a month</s>: I think New Haven can be called a "small town". And tecnically I have flatemates but we don't know each other so it's as good as living alone.</li>
      <li><s>Visit a country where I don’t speak the language</s>: Visited Japan in 2022. Used google translate to communite to people often.</li>
      <li><s>Take a scenic train ride</s>:Took the toy train to Shimla from Kalka. And enough though me and my friend slept for a chunk of that ride - it still counts :)</li>
      <li>Visit Itly: Eat their pizza. Judge for myself it all this hype all these years was wirth it or no.t</li>
      <li>Go on a multi day cruise: Find out if I do or do not like cruises and if I do or do not get seasick in the open ocean.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Create</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Take one photo every day for a year</li>
      <li>Make a 2 min travel film (even if it’s shaky)</li>
      <li><s>Publish something I write</s>: even if it’s just on this website, i guess it counts</li>
      <li>Publish 10+ blogs on this (or any other) website</li>
      <li>Publish a first author paper: Hopefully i'll have one in another year</li>
      <li>Record a lo-fi audio diary</li>
      <li>Build a tiny website that does just one weird thing</li>
      <li>Build a product that 10 people use</li>

      <li>Build a product that 100+ people use</li>

    </ul>

    </ul>
