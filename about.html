    <h1>About</h1>

        <p>Hi, I’m Kavya.</p>

        <p>Over the years, I’ve introduced myself in many ways, but most versions have followed the same predictable format:  
        “Hi, I’m Kavya. I’m XX years old. I’m a YY-year student at *insert school name*. I love playing table tennis. I like to *insert hobbies here*.”</p>

        <p>As of June 2025, that version looks something like this:</p>

        <p>Hi, I’m Kavya. I’m 23 years old, and for the first time in my life, I’ve started feeling like I’m getting older.  
        I’m a second-year grad student at Yale. Not long ago, I was at IIT Kanpur.  
        I still love playing table tennis, though I haven’t played much in the last couple of years. These days, I’m more into biking.  
        It’s fun, accessible, fits into my schedule, and most importantly it doesn’t require another person to coordinate with — all of which make it pretty appealing.</p>

        <p>I also love taking photos. I might share some on this website. Someday, who knows — maybe I’ll become a digital nomad and live off the money I make from photography. Just kidding.…Or am I?</p>
